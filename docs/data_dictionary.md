PROMPT 2 DATA DICTIONARY
**Highlighted values were recorded after the threat event ended
Threat Type: (Categorical: Air, Naval, Cyber, Missile, Hybrid)
Type of adversary threat encountered in the operational theater
enemy_unit_count: The estimated number of adversary units involved at the time of
response planning(ships, aircraft, battalions, etc.)
Enemy.Capability.Index: A composite score representing the perceived technological
sophistication, training, and readiness of adversary forces based on pre-response
assessments
ThreatEscalationHours: The estimated number of hours before the threat would escalate
if no effective response were taken
friendlyUnitCount: Total number of friendly units available or committed to the response
at the time decisions were made
LCS_COUNT: Number of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) available or assigned to the operation
Aircraft Count: Number Aircrafts available or assigned to the operation.
cyber_defense_teams: Number of dedicated defense teams available or assigned to
protect friendly networks, systems, and communications during the response window
Patriot.Batteries: Number of Patriot missile defense batteries available or deployed to
defend against ballistic or aerial threats during the operation
ISR_AssetCount: Total number of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)
assets available or tasked to support situational awareness and targeting during the
response(drones, reconnaissance aircraft, surveillance systems)
satellite coverage score: A score indicating the quality and availability of satellite
coverage over the operational theater at the time of response. Higher values indicate higher
quality
JointForceIntegration: A score indicating the coordination amongst join commands and
allied forces in the response. Higher values indicate stronger operational cohesion
EW_Capability: An Electronic Warfare (EW) capability score indicating the ability to disrupt
adversary command systems. Higher values indicate stronger EW effectiveness
Supply Chain Resilience: A score representing the reliability of supply chains supporting
the operation at the time of the threat response. Higher values indicate a stronger more
robust supply chain
PriorEngagements: The number of prior engagements or operational responses
conducted by the involved forces before this event
force_readiness_score: A score representing the operational readiness of friendly forces
at the time of the response, encompassing maintenance status, training levels, and
personnel availability. Higher values indicate better preparation at the time the threat was
made
Intel Confidence: Represents the confidence level in the intelligence used to inform
planning and execution. Higher values indicate more reliable intelligence at the time
decisions were made
ResponseTime_hrs: Time (in hours) elapsed between threat detection and the initiation of
the response
logistics_delay_hours: Estimated delay introduced by logistical constraints
CMD_COORD_SCORE: A score representing Command Coordination indicating the
effectiveness of leadership and communication
roe_complexity_score: Indicates the complexity of the rules of engagement governing the
response. Higher values suggest more restrictive or nuanced decision making constraints
Operations Budget (MUSD): The budget allocated for the response operation prior to the
execution, expressed in millions of U.S. Dollars
BudgetUtilization_pct: The planned percentage of the allocated budget expected to be
used at the time of response planning. This reflects the financial assumptions, not
outcomes
Weather_Severity: Represents the severity of weather conditions anticipated during the
response window. Higher values indicate more challenging environments
Threat Distance KM: Approximate distance from the primary command location to the
operational theater
Season: (Categorical: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
Season during which the response operation occurred (may affect environmental
conditions)
response_success: Indicates whether the response strategy successfully mitigated the
threat. 1 and “Yes” represent a successful outcome, while 0 and “No” represent
unsuccessful outcomes.
Financial_Loss_MUSD: Estimated total financial loss associated with he response,
including operational costs, damage, and secondary impacts. Values are expressed in
millions of U.S. Dollars
days_to_stabilization: The number of days elapsed between the initiation of the response
an d the point at which the threat was fully contained and operational stability was restored
